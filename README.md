# The Monkees End of Module Project
This project was created as an End Of Module Project for the Code Institute. The challenge was to create a front end only 
website for a band. The idea was to showcase the skills we've learned so far in HTML and CSS. 
This project was built as a fan page for followers of The Monkees. The intended purpose was to showcase the band's music and to inform
users that they are available to perform at special events. It was also built with the hope of attracting new fans to the band.

## UX
My site attempts to achieve its goal by providing navigation links on the homepage, to photos of the band, and its members, a discography section
containing some of the band's songs, an events section containing a list of concert dates, and a contact form for those wishing to hire the band.
The footer contains links to their various social media accounts, as well as their YouTube channel.

## Features

#### Existing Features
The site is a single scrolling page with five sections.
The first page is the Homepage which contains a large background image of the band, a video of them performing one of their most well known songs and
a Navbar at the top of the page with links to the various sections of the site. The navbar is collapsed on mobile screens with a small hamburger icon in the top
right-hand corner. It is also possible to navigate through the site using the browser's scroll bar and the arrow keys on a 
desktop / laptop computer. Following the Home Page, there is an About section which contains individual images of each band member, 
their names and role within the band. The third section is the Music section, and this informs the viewer of the band's availability
for private hire, as well as showcasing some of their work. The fourth section is a small image gallery which displays pictures of the
band. The Events section follows this with information on any upcoming concerts that the band are performing. As well as this, there 
is a contact form allowing the user to get in touch with the band and make enquiries about their availability to perform at weddings, 
Christmas Parties, and other special events. Finally, the footer contains links to their social media accounts and YouTube channel.

#### Features Left to Implement
* A 'Back to Top' button on each section of the site. 
* Carousel or lightbox for the images


## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript, for interactivity

## Testing
I validated both my HTML and CSS code using the W3C validator. I had no errors or warnings in my HTML and no errors in my CSS. I examined my site in 
both Firefox and Chrome to check for cross browser compatibility. I also used the responsive design mode in both browsers examining my site at 
various screen sizes. In Chrome and Firefox I viewed the site on the following devices:
* Galaxy S5
* Pixel 2
* Pixel 2 XL
* iPhone 5/SE
* iPhone 6/7/8
* iPhone X
* iPad
* iPad Pro
* Laptop screen

I also filled out the contact form to ensure that it worked as it was supposed to. 
As well as this, I clicked on each link in my Navbar to make sure that I was taken to the relevant section. 

## Deployment
I deployed my website via GitHub pages. I also deployed the code locally in both Chrome and Firefox.

The guitar image, which I used as a background for two of my containers I got from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/electric-guitar-ax-axe-guitar-161740/). All images are for EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY.
